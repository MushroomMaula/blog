# About me
I am student at Saarland University and currently in my 5th semester of my undergraduate degree "Data Science and Artificial Intelligence".

In my free time I like to try out the machine learning concepts taught at university or go rock climbing.

## ðŸ“– Projects
This is a list of my active open source and personal projects.

:::{card} fastapi-login
`fastapi-login` is a small wrapper around [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to make user authentication as simple as possible, while being easily customizable for all needs.

## ðŸ§—Climbing

:::{card} Kernzonen map
```{warning}
Currently not working as the official API seems to have been shutdown. You can look at the _Kernzonen_ in the [official viewer](https://geodaten.naturschutz.rlp.de/kartendienste_naturschutz/index.php) under `Schutzgebiete > Intern. Schutzgebiete > ICUN-V GeschÃ¼tzte Landschaft > BiosphÃ¤renreservatzonen`
```
A small webpage that displays a map with all _Kernzonen_ of the german state Rhineland-Palatinate. Climbing and other activities that disturb the nature in those zones is prohibited. Even though there exists a [official viewer](https://geodaten.naturschutz.rlp.de/kartendienste_naturschutz/index.php) for those, it seems like some of the zones, especially in the _PfÃ¤lzer Wald_ region, are not getting displayed.
