# About me
I am student at Saarland University and currently in my 5th semester of my undergraduate degree "Data Science and Artificial Intelligence".

In my free time I like to try out the machine learning concepts taught at university or go rock climbing.

`fastapi-login` is a small wrapper around [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to make user authentication as simple as possible, while being easily customizable for all needs.
